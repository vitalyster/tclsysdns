NetBSD

NetBSD 4.0 ships with thread-enabled Tcl 8.4.16 and
tclsysdns dumps core when using "resolver" backend
because NetBSD explicitly forbids to use res_* family
of resolver function in multi-threaded applications.

This behaviour doesn't depend on whether tclsysdns
is compiled with --enable-threads or not.

Probably, no workarounds are available for this case.
