HIGH:

* In resolver part, should probably do an early checks to skip
* parsing of RRs if none of them is needed for result set.

* Bring the list of DNS RR types in sync with
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters
  (seems like VC defines several types that are unusable
  in queries and thus should be avoided).

* Implement reverse mapping facilities for classes and types to
  their mnemonics -- this is needed for building result sets.

* Factor out functions building intermediate result sets
  and use them in the Win32 part.

* Investigate why one additional bogus (?) IP is returned
  for the "A" RR for the "www.gnu.org" query on Win32.

NORMAL:

* Bring MinGW support in sync.

* Bring lwres part in sync.

* Extensively comment unix/dnsmsg.c when it's stabilized.
  Explicitly mark mutator functions as being such.

* Result set "templating" seems impossible due to this error:
  "Tcl_ListObjAppendElement called with shared object"
  which occurs if we append a shared Tcl_Obj to a list.

LOW:

* Provide script-level command which will call res_init()
  to re-read /etc/resolv.conf, etc.

* When resolver is ready, possibly look at ADNS.
  Same for libdnsres (http://monkey.org/~provos/libdnsres/).

* What's with DNS support on Win9x/WinNT?

* An AIX communications programming reference document
  http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/v5r3/topic/com.ibm.aix.commtechref/doc/commtrf2/commtrf2.pdf
  states that in order to use the "dn_expand" resolver
  command an "_BSD" macro must be defined with values of 43 or
  44 and the library must be linked against libbsd.a.

* Create simple release packaging facilities.
