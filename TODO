HIGH:

* Move resolution of DNS RR type mnemonics to the new file
  "dnsparams.c", add resolution of DNS classes there.

* Bring the list of DNS RR types in sync with
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters
  (seems like VC defines several types that are unusable
  in queries and thus should be avoided).

* Implement facility to provide "template" Tcl lists for
  representing results of DNS queries and procs to "instantiate"
  such lists by providing Tcl_Objs for "template placeholders".

* Investigate why one additional bogus (?) IP is returned
  for the "A" RR for the "www.gnu.org" query on Win32.

NORMAL:

* Bring MinGW support in sync.

* Start implementing libresolv part.

LOW:

* What's with DNS support on Win9x/WinNT?

* Create simple release packaging facilities.
