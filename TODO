HIGH:

* Bring the list of DNS RR types in sync with
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters
  (seems like VC defines several types that are unusable
  in queries and thus should be avoided).

* Implement facility to provide "template" Tcl lists for
  representing results of DNS queries and procs to "instantiate"
  such lists by providing Tcl_Objs for "template placeholders".

* Investigate why one additional bogus (?) IP is returned
  for the "A" RR for the "www.gnu.org" query on Win32.

NORMAL:

* Bring MinGW support in sync.

* Rename [query] to [resolve] to be more line Tcllib's dns.

LOW:

* Provide script-level command which will call res_init()
  to re-read /etc/resolv.conf, etc.

* When resolver is ready, possibly look at ADNS.
  Same for libdnsres (http://monkey.org/~provos/libdnsres/).

* What's with DNS support on Win9x/WinNT?

* Create simple release packaging facilities.
